# Credit-Risk-Analysis
This assignment focuses on the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to analyze loan application data within the domain of risk analytics in the banking and financial services industry. The objective is to identify patterns and variables that serve as strong indicators of loan defaults, thereby aiding in informed decision-making to minimize the risk of financial loss while lending to customers.

Problem Statement:
Loan providers face challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of applicants, particularly those with insufficient or non-existent credit history, leading to an increased risk of defaults. The goal is to leverage EDA techniques to analyze loan application data and identify key variables that differentiate between clients with payment difficulties and those who make timely payments. This analysis aims to support decision-making processes, enabling loan providers to minimize the risk of defaults while ensuring deserving applicants are not rejected.

Insight:
The EDA process uncovered crucial insights into the loan application process and associated risks. Key variables such as applicant profiles, loan characteristics, and payment behavior emerged as significant indicators of loan defaults. By incorporating these insights into risk assessment and portfolio management strategies, lending companies can effectively screen applicants and tailor loan terms to mitigate potential losses, thereby improving overall risk management practices in the industry.
